# ExampleWeatherPredict: Weather Prediction Using Machine Learning üå§Ô∏è

**ExampleWeatherPredict** is an open-source project that uses machine learning to predict weather conditions based on historical weather data. The project leverages the power of **Random Forest Classifier** from `sklearn` to train a model and predict future weather conditions based on user inputs such as temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and more.

This project is perfect for anyone looking to learn about weather forecasting using machine learning, data preprocessing, and visualization. Whether you're a beginner or an intermediate data science enthusiast, you‚Äôll find this project a great learning tool.
